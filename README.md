To use this library for a lumped model simulation in MATLAB, first run the slblocks.m file in +C_uF folder.
You may get a pop up where you may need to add the file to path. Simply select that option.
While in the same directory, while in +C_uF folder, run the command ssc_build(). This will regenerate the library necessary to create custom centrifugal microfluidic circuits.
Then, in the Home tab, click on Simulink. You may create a new file o look at "untitled.slx"
This example circuit is meant to show the different parameters of the components available.
Please note that all the components used in the example model "untitled.slx" are all the components that are currently available for use, unless stated otherwise in this file.
